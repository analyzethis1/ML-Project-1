# ML-Project-1
A predictive maintenance model for real estate assets that can predict failures using sensor data from building systems. This model effectively trains an agent to schedule maintenance optimally and provides a dashboard for service managers to prioritize repairs.


## Project Overview
- **Goal**: Predict equipment failures using time series forecasting and reinforcement learning.
- **Business Impact**: Reduces maintenance costs by prioritizing critical repairs.

- **Phase 1:** Data Acquisition & Preprocessing  
  - Loading and cleaning raw sensor data.
  - Computing Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and generating time-series sequences.
- **Phase 2:** LSTM-based RUL Prediction with an Attention Mechanism  
  - Building, training, and evaluating an LSTM model with an Attention Layer to forecast RUL.
- **Phase 3:** Reinforcement Learning for Maintenance Optimization  
  - Training a PPO agent to decide the optimal maintenance actions.
- **Phase 4:** Deployment & Dashboard  
  - An interactive Streamlit dashboard for uploading sensor data and visualizing predictions and maintenance recommendations.

**The Big Picture:**
- **Learn Patterns:** The model learns from historical sensor data (like a mechanic diagnosing engine sounds).
- **Smart Decisions:** It recommends maintenance actions (like a service manager balancing repair costs and downtime).
- **User-Friendly:** The dashboard lets anyone upload data and get actionable insights (just like a weather app tells you to bring an umbrella!).

**Usage:**
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook or the dashboard for running the models.
3. Use the provided dashboard to upload CSV files with sensor data and view predictions.

**Requirements:**
- Python (3.x)
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Stable-Baselines3, Streamlit, etc.
- (Other dependencies as listed in the code)

**Note:** This project was developed for demonstration purposes to showcase how Machine Learning can benefit Real Estate & Development organizations who manage predictive maintenance.
