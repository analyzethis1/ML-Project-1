# ML-Project-1
A predictive maintenance model for real estate assets that can predict failures using sensor data from building systems. This model effectively trains an agent to schedule maintenance optimally and provides a dashboard for service managers to prioritize repairs.


## Project Overview
- **Goal**: Predict equipment failures (e.g., HVAC systems) using time series forecasting and reinforcement learning.
- **Business Impact**: Reduces maintenance costs by prioritizing critical repairs.
